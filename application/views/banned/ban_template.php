    <p>We truly hate banning people, and we think you're a nice person. Hopefully the conduct that got you banned will not repeat itself. If you want to let us know more about the situation, feel free to email Pixeltweak directly at tyler@manahaven.com. I can't guarantee a reply, but I will try to get back to you.

    <h4>If your conduct continues:</h4>
    <p>We will ban your IP address from our forums. Depending on the severity of the case, we will likely get in touch with your Internet Service Provider to make sure the situation is dealt with.</p>
